# My old Google Colab Notebooks
This is a collection of all my machine learning google colab notebooks for when I was learning ml in my free time in my junior year of high school.

Here you can find the GAN, the Cat and Dog classifier, and a bunch of other goodies.

Most of the jupiter notebooks, I created following the PyTorch documentation and implementing their projects.
